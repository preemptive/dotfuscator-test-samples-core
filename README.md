# PreEmptive Solutions Dotfuscator Test Samples
## üöÄ Overview
This repository houses a collection of test sample projects designed to demonstrate various C# application types and common language constructs. These samples serve as a robust test bed for Dotfuscator, providing diverse scenarios to validate its obfuscation, protection, and hardening capabilities across different Microsoft .NET platforms.

## üë• Audience
This repository is primarily intended for the technical team responsible for developing, testing, and maintaining Dotfuscator. The samples provide practical, code-based scenarios to aid in product validation, feature development, and understanding Dotfuscator's behavior across various application types.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Target Framework:
The master branch of this repository is consistently updated to target the latest supported .NET version. This ensures that samples reflect modern development practices and are compatible with the most current tooling.

## ‚ú® Key Features
**Microsoft Stack Focus**: All projects are built using the Microsoft .NET ecosystem and C#.

**Diverse Frameworks**: The solution includes projects targeting a variety of .NET application models:
- .NET API
- WPF (Windows Presentation Foundation)
- MAUI (Multi-platform App UI)
- Console App
- Windows Forms

**Comprehensive C# Constructs**: Each project is intentionally designed to incorporate a range of C# language features and application patterns, including but not limited to:
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Concepts: Abstract classes, virtual methods, interfaces, inheritance, polymorphism.
- Resource Handling: Usage of file resources, embedded resources, and other asset types.

## üì¶ Project Structure & Naming Convention
The solution is organized to clearly identify the target platform for each sample.

**Naming Convention:** All projects adhere to the following naming convention: `PreEmptive.Dotfuscator.TestSamples.{TargetPlatform}`
Examples:
- PreEmptive.Dotfuscator.TestSamples.Console
- PreEmptive.Dotfuscator.TestSamples.Api
- PreEmptive.Dotfuscator.TestSamples.Maui
- PreEmptive.Dotfuscator.TestSamples.WPF
- PreEmptive.Dotfuscator.TestSamples.WinForms
