# PreEmptive Solutions Dotfuscator Test Samples
## üöÄ Overview
This repository houses a collection of test sample projects designed to demonstrate various C# application types and common language constructs. These samples serve as a robust test bed for Dotfuscator, providing diverse scenarios to validate its obfuscation, protection, and hardening capabilities across different Microsoft .NET platforms.

## üë• Audience
This repository is primarily intended for the technical team responsible for developing, testing, and maintaining Dotfuscator. The samples provide practical, code-based scenarios to aid in product validation, feature development, and understanding Dotfuscator's behavior across various application types.

## üåø Versioning Strategy
To effectively support Dotfuscator's non-regression testing across different .NET framework versions, this repository utilizes a **long-lived release branch strategy with targeted backporting**.

- **`main` Branch:**
    - This branch always contains the test samples configured for the latest supported .NET version (e.g., .NET 8). All new development, feature enhancements, and fixes for the cutting-edge samples are primarily introduced here.
- **Release Branches (release/netX.Y):**
    - Dedicated, long-lived branches exist for older .NET versions that require ongoing non-regression testing (e.g., release/net7.0, release/net6.0).
    - Each release branch holds the complete solution configured specifically for its respective .NET framework version.
- **Backporting Changes:**
    - When an enhancement, new sample syntax, or bug fix (such as adding an inheritance example after identifying an issue) is implemented and merged into the main branch, it can be selectively backported to relevant older release branches using Git's cherry-pick command.
    - This ensures that critical test scenarios and improvements are propagated to all necessary historical versions, maintaining a robust suite for comprehensive non-regression testing.

## ‚ú® Key Features
**Microsoft Stack Focus**: All projects are built using the Microsoft .NET ecosystem and C#.

**Diverse Frameworks**: The solution includes projects targeting a variety of .NET application models:
- .NET API
- WPF (Windows Presentation Foundation)
- MAUI (Multi-platform App UI)
- Console App
- Windows Forms

**Comprehensive C# Constructs**: Each project is intentionally designed to incorporate a range of C# language features and application patterns, including but not limited to:
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Concepts: Abstract classes, virtual methods, interfaces, inheritance, polymorphism.
- Resource Handling: Usage of file resources, embedded resources, and other asset types.

## üì¶ Project Structure & Naming Convention
The solution is organized to clearly identify the target platform for each sample.

**Naming Convention:** All projects adhere to the following naming convention: `PreEmptive.Dotfuscator.TestSamples.{TargetPlatform}`
Examples:
- PreEmptive.Dotfuscator.TestSamples.Console
- PreEmptive.Dotfuscator.TestSamples.Api
- PreEmptive.Dotfuscator.TestSamples.Maui
- PreEmptive.Dotfuscator.TestSamples.WPF
- PreEmptive.Dotfuscator.TestSamples.WinForms

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation Guidelines
To get started with these test samples, follow these simple steps:

1. Clone the Repository:
```Bash
git clone https://github.com/preemptive/dotfuscator-test-samples-core.git
```

2. Install .NET SDK: Ensure you have the .NET SDK installed for the Target Framework. You can download it from the official Microsoft .NET website: https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download

3. Build the Solution: Navigate to the root of the cloned repository and build the entire solution using the .NET CLI:

```Bash
dotnet build
```
This command will restore any necessary NuGet packages and compile all projects within the solution.
