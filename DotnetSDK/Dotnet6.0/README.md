# PreEmptive Solutions Dotfuscator Test Samples

## üöÄ Overview

**PreEmptive.Dotfuscator.TestSamples** is a collection of .NET 6.0 sample applications created to showcase various C# language constructs and project structures. These test samples are specifically crafted to validate the obfuscation, protection, and hardening capabilities of **Dotfuscator** across different Microsoft .NET platforms.

All sample applications target **.NET 6.0**.

## üìÅ Projects

### 1. `PreEmptive.Dotfuscator.TestSamples.ConsoleApp`

- Demonstrates core C# constructs:
  - Abstract classes
  - Interfaces
  - Static, virtual, and override methods
- Includes embedded resource files
- Performs file read/write operations
- Fully obfuscated and protected using **Dotfuscator**

### 2. `PreEmptive.Dotfuscator.TestSamples.Helper.ParallelExecution`

- References the `ConsoleApp` DLL
- Executes multiple concurrent Dotfuscator builds in parallel
- Designed to simulate high-concurrency test environments

### 3. `PreEmptive.Dotfuscator.TestSamples.WinForms`

- Windows Form application which uses resources,Library of classes - Abstract,public, private, Interfaces , unused classes and methods
- Application implements these features
- Designed to simulate high-concurrency test environments

### 4. `PreEmptive.Dotfuscator.TestSamples.WPF`

- Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF)  application which uses resources,Library of classes - Abstract,public, private, Interfaces , unused classes and methods
- Application implements these features
- Designed to simulate high-concurrency test environments

## üîß Purpose

These projects serve as a robust testbed to:

- Evaluate Dotfuscator's performance under varied application structures
- Validate obfuscation and protection behaviors in real-world C# scenarios
- Test parallelism and concurrency in obfuscation workflows
